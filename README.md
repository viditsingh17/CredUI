# CredUI

This is a one page app showing off hi-fi UI. I followed a tutorial on youtube to successfully complete this and the main idea behind it was to learn the best practices and general coding in Flutter.

## What did I learn in this?

~ Adding shadows to UI elements.

~ Making Pie charts.

~ Making custom UI elemets like credit cards.
